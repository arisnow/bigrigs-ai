1.  Identify every line item that is a hazardous material.
2.  For each one, extract the UN Number, Proper Shipping Name, Hazard Class, Packing Group, and Quantity exactly as they appear.
3.  Also, list any major fields that are obviously empty, like "Carrier Name" or signatures.
4.  Do NOT interpret, analyze, calculate, or apply any regulations. Just extract the visible text.

**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  **Placarding (49 CFR §172.504):**
    *   First, for each hazard class in the data, calculate the total aggregate weight. You MUST perform this calculation. Use an estimated weight of 8 lbs per gallon for liquids. For example, write down: "Class 3 total weight: X lbs", "Class 8 total weight: Y lbs".
    *   Next, consult the placarding tables. "Table 1" materials always get a placard.
    *   For a "Table 2" material (like Class 3 or Class 8), a placard is required ONLY if its calculated aggregate gross weight is 1,001 lbs (454 kg) or more.
    *   Based ONLY on the weights you calculated, list the final required placards. Use the official placard text (e.g., "FLAMMABLE", "CORROSIVE"), not the class number. If a class is under the weight threshold, do NOT include its placard.
2.  **Incompatibilities (49 CFR §177.848):**
    *   Consult the Segregation Table for Hazardous Materials for the provided hazard classes.
    *   Report an incompatibility **only if** the intersection for a pair on the table contains an "X" or "O". If blank, they are compatible.
3.  **Document Validity:** The document is invalid if there are any missing fields.
4.  **Compliance Score:** Provide a score out of 10. Deduct points for missing fields, incorrect placarding, or incompatibilities.
5.  **ERG Data:** For each line item, provide the corresponding 2020 ERG summary based on its UN number.

**JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
Return a single JSON object matching this structure exactly, populating it with your analysis.
